# CroxSwap Token List Info
## Overview
The CroxSwap Token List is a list of tokens with accurate and up-to-date information, powering additional information on the BSC.

[CroxSwap DEX](https://exchange.croxswap.com) uses token logos from this source, alongside a number of other projects.

There are also third party projects which use this source for more up-to-the minute data.

The repository contains token info from the Binance smart Chain.

## How to add token

Please note that brand new tokens are not accepted,
the projects have to be sound, with information available, and non-minimal circulation

### Requirements
Requirements: 300 holders and 1000 transactions. 

There is no processing fee for partnered tokens to get listed but we encourage you to provide a buy link to our DEX on your website . **FREE!**




### Quick starter

**Adding an BEP20 token checklist**:
- [ ] Make sure your smartcontract has more than 300 address holders & 1000 transactions, otherwise you will be rejected. Dust attacks do not qualify.
- [ ] Fork the Github repository
- [ ] Create folder with name of token smartcontact address in [_checksum format_](https://bit.ly/3nw8OhN) `bsc/assets/<token_smartcontract_address>/`.
- [ ] *** MAKE SURE THE FOLDER NAME IS IN CHECKSUM FORMAT *** https://ethsum.netlify.app/
- [ ] Tell your designer that token image must be in PNG format, avoid transparent background, recommended size 256x256px, max. 512x512px, with max file size of 100kB. We use trust wallet's [image rules](https://developer.trustwallet.com/add_new_asset#image-requirements).
- [ ] Upload your logo with file named `logo.png` to previously created folder with smartcontract address, and if you done all correctly your path should look like this. `bsc/assets/0x1234567461d3f8Db7496581774Bd869C83D51c93/logo.png`
- [ ] Create `info.json` file with info about the token/project (we expand on Trustwallet's info.json, see below)
- [ ] Create a pull request to the main repo


Please do take a moment to look at an existing project to view how best to integrate into our list.
